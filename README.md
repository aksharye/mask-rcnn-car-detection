## Introduction
This was a fun project I undertook in 2020 as an exercise in object detection. Mask R-CNN is a deep-learning method that identifies objects down to the pixel instead of just a single bounding box. This was my final project for the North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) Online Program's Data Science for Scientist course. I wrote a beginner-friendly paper on the performance of several trained Mask R-CNN models published in NCSSM's in-house student journal [Broad Street Scientific](https://issuu.com/ncssmedu/docs/bss2021/62).

## Dataset
The data used in this project comes from a stream of labeled images taken from a car, from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alincijov/self-driving-cars) created by Alin Cijov.
